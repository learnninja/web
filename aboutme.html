<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>By now, you've probably already figured out that I'm just another nerd on the web!</h2>
<br />
<p><font size="5">
  And you won't be entirely wrong to think that. <strong>I am a Web Developer</strong>. I am also an avid learner of new skills. I am usually found in my
  natural habitat either in my little cubicle in Microsoft or fidgeting with websites at home (or coffee shops sometimes). When you come
  looking for me and I am not there designing and building website, you could find me in places where there are plenty of hiking trails or
  golden retrievers or coffee beans or all three (is there such a place? Leave me a <a href="https://heeeeeeeey.com/" target="_blank">private message</a> if you know such a place)
  </font></p>

    As you just saw, I lead a pretty boring life. But hey........... (hooooooooooo!), I designed and built this website you're currently enjoying. And if you enjoyed it too much
    and can't wait to talk to me about any full time or part time opportunities, here's a <a href="http://eelslap.com/" target="_blank">link</a> to my resume.
    I can't wait to talk to you. And thanks for reading this far. You're awesome!!
